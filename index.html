        <p class="described">A day in the life of a reforestation volunteer in Brazil.This summer, our own Ashley <br> traveled to the spectacularly mountainous to take part in the expedition Wildlife <br> and Reforestation in Brazil.

            <ul>
               <li>Waking up in the midst of nature in the morning.
                I'm not a morning person <br>in any sense, but the best time to spot wildlife is at dawn and dusk. And <br> I'm not about to waste any sunrises when I have the rare opportunity to <br> visit one of the world's most beautiful place. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Stepping onto the lush trails.
                    Several trails snake through the grounds of, all <br> of which are available to volunteers during their free time. There have been <br> wildlife spotting on all of them, including capybara (the world's largest <br> rodent), tapirs, and a plethora of birds.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Morning in the mountain mist.
                    I quietly walk up the metal spiral stairs to the <br> top of the lookout tower, trying not to make any loud noises that'd scare <br> away nearby wildlife. Once I get to the top, I see beautiful <br> view in the mountains.
